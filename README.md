### Hi, I'm Felix Gutierrez



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing up my Fullstack web dev Certificate from Ut Austin.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React! I was excited to learn it from the beginning. And while my bootcamp module has been helpful, I've really used my time to dive deep into React and I really love this framework. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a serial learner! Coding is just my newest obsession. I love to dive deep into topics like science, philosophy, theology, etc. and just continue to read and learn and exhaust the topic at hand. I've also held jobs as a cross-country commercial truck driver, a mechanic, and an HTST operator in a milk/dairy plant.
